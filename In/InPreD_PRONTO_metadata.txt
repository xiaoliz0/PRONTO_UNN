# Information contained within this file is intended for use in automated creation of InPreD mol-MDT report (the PRONTO image).															
# Each data row is meant for describing the meta-information of a single DNA or RNA sample sequenced with the TSO500 assay and post-processed with the TSOPPI package.															
# - If TSOPPI is run with matching DNA and RNA, information from both DNA and RNA will be printed into the mol-MDT report.															
"# - Please use ""-"" to represent any missing values."															
# - Tabulator values should be used for separating individual columns.															
# - The meta-information will be used as-is.															
"# Overview of individual columns and their expected values (columns marked with ""[REQ]"" are required for mol-MDT report creation; columns without this tag are optional):"															
"# - [REQ] ""Sample_id"": sample identifier as used in TSOPPI post-processing; the ID should follow the InPreD sample ID nomenclature;"															
"# - [REQ] ""Sequencing_run_id"": sequencing run identifier as used in TSOPPI post-processing;"															
"# - [REQ] ""Create_report"": mol-MDT reports will only be created for DNA samples with value ""Y"" in this column; expected values for DNA [""Y"", ""N""]; and for RNA ""-"";"															
"# - ""Year_of_birth"": patient's year of birth; in integer format;"															
"# - ""Year_of_diagnosis"": year of disease diagnosis; in integer format;"															
"# - ""Clinical_diagnosis"": disease diagnosis (not limited to the PCGR tumor site classification); in string format;"															
"# - ""Sex"": patient sex; expected values: [""M"", ""F""];"															
"# - ""Study_id"": sample/patient study identifier, e.g., an IMPRESS id; in string format;"															
"# - ""Sample_material_id"": sample material identifier as documented in the pathology system; in string format;"															
"# - ""Year_of_sample_collection"": year of sample material collection; in integer format;"															
"# - ""Requisition_hospital"": hospital requiring the InPreD sample analysis; in string format;"															
"# - ""Extraction_hospital"": hospital undertaking the sample extraction; in string format."															
"# - ""Tumor_content_pathology"": tumor content in percent estimated by the pathologist; not necessarily the value used in TSOPPI and written into the mol-MDT report;"															
"# - ""Batch"": batch information from the wet lab."
